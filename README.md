# Mert's Python and Engineering Learning Journey
My First GitHub Repo

This repository has been created to track Mert's learning journey in Python and engineering. While there aren't any active projects yet, future Python projects, engineering applications, and learned concepts will be shared here.

# Future Plans
1. Develop basic and advanced projects in Python.
2. Create content related to engineering projects.
3. Provide guides for contributors in future projects.
4. Develop a machine learning-based chatbot. In the future, I plan to implement machine learning techniques to make the chatbot smarter.

# Contributing
Once the projects begin, guidelines for those who want to contribute to this repository will be provided.
